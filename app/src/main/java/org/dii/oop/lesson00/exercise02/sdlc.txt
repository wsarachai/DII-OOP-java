SDLC Meaning (Software Development Life Cycle)

An SDLC (software development life cycle) is a big-picture breakdown of all the steps involved in software creation (planning, coding, testing, deploying, etc.). Companies define custom SDLCs to create a predictable, iterative framework that guides the team through all major stages of development.

The character and the exact number of phases in an SDLC vary between businesses and projects. The most common models are variations on the following steps:

Requirement analysis.
In-depth planning.
Product design.
Coding.
Testing.
Deployment.
Post-production maintenance.
