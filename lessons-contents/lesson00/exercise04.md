## [Lesson00](index.md) > Exercise04:

Write a program to calculate the addition of the integers in files a.txt and b.txt. Then, the addition is written into file c.txt.


1. Open class [App](../../app/src/main/java/org/dii/oop/App.java) in package `org.dii.oop.App` and edit the code as display below:
   ```
   package org.dii.oop;
   import java.io.*;
   import org.dii.oop.lesson00.exercise04.Lesson;

   public class App {
     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

       System.output.println("Start....Exercise 4: Addition and Write the output to file c.txt");
   
       Lesson.run();
    }
   }
   ```
   2.  Open class [Lesson 00 - Exercise 4 - Lesson.java File](../../app/src/main/java/org/dii/oop/lesson00/exercise04/Lesson.java) in package `org.dii.oop.lessoon00.exercise04`.
    
       Edit the code to open files a.txt and b.txt. In these two files, the number of integers in each row is 1000.
